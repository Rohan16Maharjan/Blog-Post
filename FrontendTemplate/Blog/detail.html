				In communications and information processing, code is a system of rules
				to convert information—such as a letter, word, sound, image, or
				gesture—into another form, sometimes shortened or secret, for
				communication through a communication channel or storage in a storage
				medium. An early example is the invention of language, which enabled a
				person, through speech, to communicate what they thought, saw, heard or
				felt to others. But speech limits the range of communication to the
				distance a voice can carry, and limits the audience to those present
				when the speech is uttered . The invention of writing, which converted
				spoken language into visual symbols, extended the range of communication
				across space and time. The process of encoding converts information from
				a source into symbols for communication or storage. Decoding is the
				reverse process, converting code symbols back into a form that the
				recipient understands, such as English or/and Spanish. One reason for
				coding is to enable communication in places where ordinary plain
				language, spoken or written, is difficult or impossible. For example,
				semaphore, where the configuration of flags held by a signaler or the
				arms of a semaphore tower encodes parts of the message, typically
				individual letters and numbers. Another person standing a great distance
				away can interpret the flags and reproduce the words sent. In
